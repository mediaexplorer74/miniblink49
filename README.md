# MiniBlink49
My fork of favorite MiniBlink49 project. I have my _failed_ own MediaExplorer one based on it. 
It's my attempt #2 to explore this huuuge, mystic chrome-based browser engine :)

## About
A lighter and faster blink browser core for integrating the HTML interface into your application. Compact and lightweight browser core to replace wke and libcef

## Note / statement
Since this project was hacked and used for illegal purposes after changing the source code, I was contacted several times.... After careful consideration, it was decided not to update from 2019-6-17. However, subsequent updates will be released in binary format and in header files, keep this in mind.

The download address of the binary file and header file: https://github.com/weolar/miniblink49/releases

I hope everyone respects the open source code and the work of the author, who has continued to be updated over the past few years.

## Usage
The easiest way to create a window is：
// Form without margins window without margins
Window wkeWebView = wkeCreateWebWindow(WKE_WINDOW_TYPE_TRANSPARENT, NULL, 0, 0, 640, 480);
wkeLoadURLW(window, L"miniblink.net ");


## Compilation
It is not recommended to compile by yourself. Please follow the link <url> to download the compiled file and use it.

Since there are a large number of updates every day, I cannot guarantee that every update will guarantee that the compilation will be successful. If a compilation error has occurred, please do not ask questions and wait patiently for my next submission.

## Mini-electron
The mini-electron project is an independent project based on miniblink, which aims to create a smaller electron operating environment. At the moment, this goal has been achieved.

When replacing the mini-electron, the size of the packed file is only about 6 MB.
